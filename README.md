# Cordeliere
Robotics project at the ENSTA Bretagne. The aim is to localize "La Cordeli√®re", a French ship which sunk in the "Goulet de Brest" in 1512.

This repository has a submodule of [Cordeliere_ROSws](https://github.com/EnstaBretagneClubRobo/Cordeliere_ROSws.git). By default, you don't download it with `git clone` or `git fetch` (the goal is that if you aren't working on this feature, you don't have to download the whole repository). 
In order to download it, use `git clone --recursive` for a clone, or `git submodule update --init --recursive` if you have already cloned this repository.

The Schematics "Software_Architecture.png" was generated with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) and the source file is "Software_Architecture.xml".
