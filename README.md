# Cordeliere
Robotics project at the ENSTA Bretagne. The aim is to localize "La Cordelière", a French ship which sunk in the "Goulet de Brest" in 1512.

This repository has a submodule of [Cordeliere_ROSws](https://github.com/EnstaBretagneClubRobo/Cordeliere_ROSws.git). By default, you don't download it with `git clone` or `git fetch` (the goal is that if you aren't working on this feature, you don't have to download the whole repository). In order to download it, use `git clone --recursive` for a clone, or `git submodule update --init --recursive` if you have already clone this repository.
